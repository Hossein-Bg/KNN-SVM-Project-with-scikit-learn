# KNN & SVM Project

Consider the following two class probability distributions
* A) First, randomly generate 70 training samples for the first class and 300 training samples for the second class and use that data set on the KNN classifier.
Train and then report its accuracy and F1-Score
* B) Now generate 100 training samples for the first class and 100 training samples for the second class randomly and train those two sets again on the KNN classifier.
and report its accuracy and F1-Score
* c) In this step, train the data set generated in part A on the SVM classifier and report its accuracy and F1-score.
